The design and implementation of anFS

Written by Hyogi Sim <hyogi@vt.edu>


Introduction
============
ActiveFS is a new filesystem, which exploits active osds to process active jobs
in the storage. ActiveFS sits on top of multiple number of active osds.

Compilation
===========

anFS is based on the autotools, the compilation of the code is therefore
composed of 3 different steps:

1/ Run autogen.sh (e.g., "./autogen.sh")
2/ Run configure (e.g., "./configure --prefix=/my/install/dir --with-libosd=/path/where/is/libosd/code
3/ Run make (e.g., "make")
